We&rsquo;re great at what we do.</strong></h4><p>We&rsquo;re a team of highly experienced IT services professionals. Our diverse customer base and operational experience make us uniquely suited to help you address your current challenges and secure the long-term health of your business.</p><p>When you work with our experts, you can be confident that our recommendations are sound and that we&rsquo;re able to successfully implement your chosen solution.</p><h4><strong>2. We know what you&rsquo;re up against.</strong></h4><p>We regularly see business drivers that are creating challenges and opportunities for our customers including:</p><p><strong>Compliance.</strong>&nbsp;Mandatory industry and government compliance rules are creating complexity and risk for many businesses. Civil and criminal penalties related to HIPAA and PCI as well as other State and Federal penalties are on the rise, and businesses of all sizes need to make sure they have the necessary IT systems and practices in place to meet compliance requirements.</p><div style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 1pt 4pt;"><p style="border: none; padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Data breaches cost hospitals in the U.S. more than $12,000,000,000 in 2010.<sup>1</sup></span></p></div><p><strong>The Cloud.</strong>&nbsp;Organizations are increasingly looking to cloud-based solutions not just to lower costs but also to take advantage of powerful new features. Cloud computing provides infrastructure with predictable operating expenses and a lower cost than do-it-yourself solutions. A move to the cloud often increases reliance on third party vendors as well as an increased need for integration.</p><div style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 1pt 4pt;"><p style="border: none; padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">In 2011, 3% of Enterprise IT operations were cloud-based. By 2015, this figure will climb to 43%.<sup>2</sup></span></p></div><p><strong>The &ldquo;Always On&rdquo; Enterprise.</strong>&nbsp;More than ever, workers are demanding 24x7 reliability for critical enterprise systems and applications. A failure to meet those needs not only reduces productivity and wastes resources but also can lead to employee frustration and lower morale.</p><div style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 1pt 4pt;"><p style="border: none; padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Mid-sized businesses experience the most IT downtime with an average hourly cost of $74,000 and an annual cost of more than $880,000.<sup>3</sup></span></p></div><p><strong>The Talent Shortage.</strong>&nbsp;Good help is proving hard to find. Few organizations have adequate IT personnel to cover all of their identified projects and support needs. In response to the growing talent shortage, many organizations find that they have to ration their staffing and only work on the most urgent and often reactionary IT issues.</p><div style="border: 1pt solid windowtext; padding: 1pt 4pt;"><p style="border: none; padding: 0in;"><span style="font-size: small;">Employers recently listed <em>IT Staff</em> as one of the Top 10 most difficult positions to fill. The majority stated that a shortage of talent is currently impacting their ability to meet client needs.<sup>4</sup></span></p></div><h4><strong>3.
