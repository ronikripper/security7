The Internet is one of most important resources your employees will require. Unfortunately, if not controlled properly, granting access to the internet can create its own inefficiencies.</p><p>With free access to the internet, employees may be prone to use it for non-work related task. By introducing the ability to control access to certain types of content such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and even Netflix, you ensure that your employees are staying on task throughout the day. Some employees may require access to certain sites for promotion and marketing purposes, while others do not. With our Content Filtering solution, you can control who is given access to what by setting up specific user groups with appropriate access levels.</p><p>By creating user groups and assigning access rights to them, you control what messages filter to what groups. You also control what is designated as spam for those groups, and what isn't. After your initial configuration of the software, you can then move users into groups, thoroughly managing the type of content made available to them.</p><h2>Reduce Security Threats</h2><br><h4>Gain complete control over your security by blocking access to dangerous and distasteful content.</h4><br><p>One of the most crucial parts of business administration is being able to protect personal information and other sensitive material. Unfortunately, there are people in the world that mine for information and sell it for their own self-interest. A number of these entities are specifically designed to retrieve information with the use of coordinated instructions.</p><p>Some of these strategies involve delivering malware in the form of a virus, Trojan horse, or Internet worm to distasteful mediums that get a lot of traffic. If a user accidentally navigates to these types of sites, it can create security problems. A simple search for &ldquo;free software&rdquo; can lead users to infested sites that look completely legitimate. Once a user downloads the file and opens it, your entire network can be compromised with malicious entities.</p><p>With our Content Filtering solution, you have complete control over the prevention of these types of threats. You can have the ability to protect your business from unwanted intruders with Security7 Networks&rsquo;s content filtering service. If you are a small or midsize business in the New Hampshire area, and want more information about how Security7 Networks can find valuable solutions to all your company's points of contention, call us today at (877) 664-9379.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr class="sep20" /><p>&nbsp;</p></div><div class="four columns"><div class="widget"><span class="brd-headling"></span><div class="clearfix">&nbsp;</div>
