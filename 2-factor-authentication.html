Leaked, lost, or stolen data can reveal sensitive passwords and user accounts that can jeopardize security and confidentiality, and cause major issues and public mistrust.<br /><br />AccessWerx is the integration of a two-factor authentication system, which is defined as:</p><ol><li>Something you know, such as a password.</li><li>Something you have, such as a card, token, or mobile phone.</li></ol><p><br />Without the exact combination of ca orrect password in addition to the physical device, access won't be granted. This approach exponentially increases security and only allows those with precise authentication to gain access.</p><h3>Smartphone Authentication</h3>&nbsp;<p><strong>Leverage staff smartphone devices to increase overall data and access security. </strong>Many firms have already found the value in utilizing the power of modern smartphones for their businesses. From effortless communication to powerful productivity apps, smartphones have become invaluable to businesses of all types and sizes. AccessWerx can require employees to provide their password identification as well as an authentication code sent to their smartphones in order to gain secure remote access or other systems that require authentication. Most importantly, rules can be applied to smartphones from the mail server that enforce security policies such as passwords and the ability to remotely wipe smartphones in the event they are lost or stolen.</p><h3>Identity Management Solutions</h3>&nbsp;<p><strong>Control and manage access and strict authorization policies throughout your network.</strong><br /><br />Security7 Networks can provide a wide range of security solutions that help you ensure only authorized personnel have access to resources appropriate to their role.
