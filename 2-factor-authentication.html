         <h3>What is AccessWerx?</h3><br>
<h4><img style="margin: 5px 5px 23px; float: right;" src="/images/accesswerx.png" alt="two-factor authentication" width="170" height="193"/>Two-Factor Authentication is a strong security practice that involves two types of validation in order to access confidential or sensitive information or systems.</h4><br>
<p>Passwords are only as secure as the people who know them.  Leaked, lost, or stolen data can reveal sensitive passwords and user accounts that can jeopardize security and confidentiality, and cause major issues and public mistrust.<br/><br/>AccessWerx is the integration of a two-factor authentication system, which is defined as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Something you know, such as a password.</li>
<li>Something you have, such as a card, token, or mobile phone.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/>Without the exact combination of ca orrect password in addition to the physical device, access won't be granted. This approach exponentially increases security and only allows those with precise authentication to gain access.</p>

From effortless communication to powerful productivity apps, smartphones have become invaluable to businesses of all types and sizes. AccessWerx can require employees to provide their password identification as well as an authentication code sent to their smartphones in order to gain secure remote access or other systems that require authentication. Most importantly, rules can be applied to smartphones from the mail server that enforce security policies such as passwords and the ability to remotely wipe smartphones in the event they are lost or stolen.</p>
