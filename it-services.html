<p>Information systems and the associated data have become vital assets for most organizations.

To safeguard these assets, all organizations need to develop a written corporate IT security policy that defines how IT assets are to be protected, expected employee behaviors, and the consequences of violations.</p>

<p><strong>Security monitoring and testing is vital to ensure the integrity of sensitive corporate data and to comply with regulatory mandates like SOX, PCI DSS, and HIPAA/HITECH.</strong></p>
