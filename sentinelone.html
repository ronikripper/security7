It delivers a complete endpoint security platform to continuously predict, prevent, detect, and respond to advanced threats. Only SentinelOne provides a fully integrated defense system that adapts and responds to threats before, during, and after attacks.</p><p>SentinelOne is a startup formed by an elite team of cyber security engineers and defense experts who joined forces to reinvent endpoint protection. With decades of collective experience, SentinelOne founders honed their expertise while working for Intel, McAfee, Checkpoint, IBM, and elite units in the Israel Defense Forces. They came together in 2013 to build a new security architecture that could defeat today&rsquo;s advanced threats and nation state malware.</p><h2>3 Layers of Protection</h2><br><h4>1. Prevents Threats at Inception</h4><ul><li>Our first line of defense stops the majority of malware, even one-of-a-kind advanced threats, by detecting and predicting threat behavior the instant it starts.</li><li>Monitors all endpoint activity at all times, tracking each newly-created process to detect memory modifications, heap spray attempts, and exploitation techniques</li><li>Predicts what the threat will do next based on attack patterns, evasion techniques, and up-to-the-minute crowdsourced threat intelligence</li><li>Moves ahead of the attack to block its next move in real time</li></ul><br><h4>2. Stops Attacks as They Unfold</h4><p>Application monitoring runs non-stop to catch the small percentage of threats that progress to the next stage.</p><ul><li>Analyzes threat behavior based on low-level instrumentation of all OS activities and operations, including memory, disk, registry, network, and more</li><li>Detects and tags anomalies using behavioral logic derived from advanced clustering techniques and machine learning</li><li>Predicts the attack sequence, using dynamic behavioral patterning to accurately sort, optimize, and build context around the attack</li><li>Stops the threat from fully executing to prevent damage and data loss</li><li>Creates and shares behavioral patterns to prevent the spread of infection to other endpoints</li></ul><br><h4>3. Detects and Removes Active Threats</h4><p>As a last line of defense, our advanced threat sensors detect, block, and remove advanced threats that are already entrenched.</p><ul><li>Finds hidden threats by detecting kernel tampering, exfiltration attempts, and aberrant behavior, including &ldquo;low and slow&rdquo; stealth activity that&rsquo;s invisible to other defenses</li><li>Shuts down the attack, removes malware, cleans up any damage, rolls back changes when possible, and alerts administrators to a security breach&mdash;a fully automated incident response</li><li>Minimizes damage and data theft by reducing threat dwell time</li><li>Shares new threat intelligence to prevent reinfection and protect all endpoints in the crowdsourced community, creating a full circle defense system</li></ul><br><h2>One single solution secures:</h2><ul><li>Desktops</li><li>Laptops</li><li>Physical and Virtual Servers</li><li>Embedded Systems like POS</li><li>Virtual Desktop</li><li>Critical Infrastructure like SCADA</li><li>Tablets and Smartphones&nbsp;</li></ul><br><h2>Advanced Threats: The Dramatic Shift</h2><p>Targeted attacks and advanced threats are more sophisticated than ever. They are specifically designed to infiltrate your organization and slip past security, using one-of-a-kind polymorphic malware and obfuscation techniques to avoid detection. Once inside, they set up command and control (C&amp;C) communications, open backdoors, and steal data.</p><p>Most attacks start by targeting your endpoints, where your organization is most vulnerable. Conventional signature-based antivirus (AV) is no longer working and network-based monitoring and sandbox analysis too often they fail to prevent and remediate damage. Attackers have developed anti-virtual machine techniques to create sandbox-aware malware that will act benign until it is running on an unprotected target device.</p><h4>Bridge the IT Silos</h4><p>SentinelOne endpoint protection secures all major platforms&mdash; more than any other endpoint security. With a single pane of glass, you can now unify protection across: Windows OS X Android soon iOS &amp; Linux. There&rsquo;s no need to manage multiple disparate products to secure each platform. This only increases costs and decreases effectiveness. By closing the gaps that separate platforms, SentinelOne endpoint protection improves security and visibility across all endpoints, from data centers to smartphones.</p><h4>True Remediation</h4><p>SentinelOne endpoint protection goes the full distance, automating cleanup and threat removal. This is a significant advantage over network and endpoint monitoring products that stop short of remediation. In most cases, they will alert you to a new attack and provide recommendations on how you might be able to block and remove the malware yourself. This is no easy task and will add to your administrative overhead.</p><h4>Set It and Forget It</h4><p>Most EDR solutions require dedicated IT staff to effectively sort through massive amounts of data. In contrast, SentinelOne endpoint protection is fully automated, requiring almost zero administration. Up-to-the-minute threat intelligence, contextual data, and threat activity are correlated automatically in real time&mdash;to deliver faster protection and minimize or prevent damage.</p><h4>Real-time Forensics</h4><p>The SentinelOne EDR agent monitors and collects data on the endpoint. The data is sent to the management console and is used to compile real-time forensic information to identify where attacks originated and trace malicious actions. This approach provides the investigative capabilities comparable to that of a sandbox, only delivered in real time by the agent through dynamic analysis reports.</p><h4>Whitelisting</h4><p>The SentinelOne EDR whitelist feature provides another level of proactive protection against advanced threats. This default deny approach allows you to specify which applications are considered safe and can run as well as blacklisting malicious applications from infecting other machines on the network.</p><h4>Cloud Intelligence</h4><p>Cloud intelligence extends the protection of SentinelOne EDR to block known threats using a unique approach called &ldquo;passive scanning&rdquo;. The SentinelOne EDR agent constantly monitors every file and process on the endpoint and sends file information to the cloud intelligence reputation service where it is scanned in real time by over 40 scan engines and leverages the intelligence from leading reputation services. When a known threat is detected it is immediately blocked before the user is exposed to any risk.</p><h4>Real-Time Threat Prediction</h4><p>Our patent-pending predictive execution inspection engine predicts threat behavior in real time, as the threat unfolds. This allows us to move ahead of the attack and block its next move&mdash;instantly. Only SentinelOne EDR provides a fully integrated adaptive defense system to address the entire threat lifecycle&mdash;before, during, and after attack. 3 Layers of Adaptive &nbsp;Prevents initial exploits &nbsp;Stops threats as they attempt to execute &nbsp;Detects and removes hidden infiltrations</p><h4>Full Cycle of Protection</h4><p>It&rsquo;s clear we need a new approach to endpoint security&mdash;one that doesn&rsquo;t rely on static signatures, whitelists, or static IOCs. We also need faster, ongoing incident response to reduce dwell times and costly damage. Prevention alone is not enough. Analysts and security pros agree: we have to assume some threats will slip past even the best security. SentinelOne EDR combines true behavioral detection, cloud intelligence, and whitelisting capabilities to provide a full cycle of protection from detection to prevention. This fully integrated adaptive defense system addresses the entire threat lifecycle&mdash;before, during, and after attacks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
