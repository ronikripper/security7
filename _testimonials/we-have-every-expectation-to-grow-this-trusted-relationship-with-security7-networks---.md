Security7 Networks has been our trusted IT managed service provider for three years. We started the relationship during our business startup and they have been key to our success at every step along the way from build-out and provisioning through product development and now production manufacturing. Security7 Networks engineered a three-tiered network security architecture and has renovated and integrated other networks that we have acquired. Security7 Networks provide exceptional network monitoring and contract maintenance, and persistently works with us to improve security and to manage costs. An aspect of the business relationship that I did not account for at the outset but now value highly is the cooperation and leadership that Security7 Networks has developed with our other managed service providers. We have every expectation to grow this trusted relationship with Security7 Networks.
