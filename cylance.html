Using a breakthrough predictive analysis process, Cylance quickly and accurately identifies what is safe and what is a threat, not just what is in a blacklist or whitelist. By coupling sophisticated machine learning and artificial intelligence with a unique understanding of a hacker&rsquo;s mentality, Cylance provides the technology and services to be truly predictive and preventive against advanced threats.</p><p><strong>Future-Proof Endpoint Security</strong></p><p><strong></strong>CylancePROTECT redefines what antivirus (AV) can and should do for your organization by leveraging artificial intelligence to detect AND prevent malware from executing on your endpoints in real time. By taking a mathematical approach to malware identification utilizing patent-pending, machine learning techniques instead of reactive signatures and sandboxes, CylancePROTECT renders new malware, viruses, bots and unknown future variants useless. Cylance has developed the most accurate, efficient and effective solution for preventing advanced persistent threats and malware from executing on your organization&rsquo;s endpoints. At the core of Cylance&rsquo;s unprecedented malware identification capability is a revolutionary machine learning research platform that harnesses the power of algorithmic science and artificial intelligence. It analyzes and classifies hundreds of thousands of characteristics per file, breaking them down to an atomic level to discern whether an object is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; in real time.</p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><p><strong></strong>CylancePROTECT&rsquo;s architecture consists of a small agent that integrates with existing software management systems or Cylance&rsquo;s own cloud console. The endpoint will detect and prevent malware through the use of tested mathematical models on the host, independent of a cloud or signatures. It is capable of detecting and quarantining malware in both open and isolated networks without the need for continual signature updates. Defense requires applying the best protection at the most vulnerable locations - the endpoints. Cylance&rsquo;s mathematical approach stops the execution of harmful code regardless of having prior knowledge or employing an unknown obfuscation technique. No other anti-malware product compares to the accuracy, ease of management and effectiveness of CylancePROTECT.</p><p><strong>Future-Proof Security</strong></p><p><strong></strong>By applying math models to the endpoint, the Cylance engine easily surpasses all traditional methods of malware detection and prevention. Our mission is to stop the execution of bad files before they can cause any damage. With this approach, the endpoint remains secure and unviolated even if the file is resident on disk. CylancePROTECT&reg; CylancePROTECT is our flagship enterprise product that harnesses the power of the Cylance engine to prevent the execution of advanced threats in real-time on each endpoint in the organization.</p><p>Key Features:</p><ul><li>Protection and detection of previously undetectable advanced threats</li><li>&nbsp;</li><li>Cloud-enabled, but not cloud dependent for sensitive environments</li><li>No daily .DAT updates which eliminates the need for an &ldquo;always-on&rdquo; connection</li><li>Extremely low performance impact; runtime execution dramatically reduces overhead</li><li>Easy to deploy and manage with a purpose-built web interface</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>CylancePROTECT provides real-time detection and prevention of malware. It operates by analyzing potential file executions for malware in both the operating system (OS) and memory layers and prevents the delivery of malicious payloads. Memory protection is designed to be extremely low-touch as to not incur a heavy performance overhead. Instead, memory protection strengthens basic OS protection features like DEP, ASLR and EMET by providing an additional layer to detect and deny certain behaviors which are very commonly used by exploits.</p><p>These two core functions are supported by a variety of ancillary features necessary for enterprise functionality including:</p><ul><li>Whitelist and blacklist support for administrative granularity</li><li>Detect-only mode (audit mode)</li><li>Self-protection (prevention against user tampering)</li><li>Complete control, update and configurability from the management console</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div><!-- /left side col --><!-- Right sidebar --><div class="four columns">&nbsp;<h2><strong>Security Concerns?</strong></h2>&nbsp;<h3>Do you have questions about IT Services and what they can do for your company?
