<h2>What is SecureWerx?</h2>
<p><strong>Security monitoring and testing is vital to ensure the integrity of sensitive corporate data and to comply with regulatory mandates like SOX, PCI DSS, and HIPAA/HITECH.</strong></p>
<p>Today, security risks are more threatening than ever, and your IT Department may not have all of the resources or expertise to keep up with a changing security landscape. Internal IT's assessments of your security practices may fall short and fail to identify gaps and weaknesses in your security infrastructure.</p>
<p>With our expertise, we can identify gaps and implement solutions to close them making your information assets safer and more secure.</p>
<h2>Services we offer:</h2>
<p><strong>Managed Security:</strong> Our staff of security experts can design and implement a new security infrastructure or manage the one you currently have with our <em>24/7 monitoring center</em>. Along with many other services we offer, we will manage your firewall and antimalware software and provide a solid data backup and recovery system should disaster strike.</p>
<p><strong>General Audit:</strong> Review of controls and policies around your network, data assets, and infrastructure. Evaluate the state of your information security program in regard to security and operational procedures. Assess compliance with best practices and regulation requirements. Identify where gaps lie, and provide solutions to fix them.</p>
<p><strong>Client-side Penetration and Social Engineering:</strong> Identify risks with user machines and applications, test employee preparedness against phishing attempts, and identify if your employees are your weakest links.</p>
<p><strong>Enterprise Risk Assessment and Analysis:</strong> Assess company-wide security policies and practices. Identify areas of improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Network Security and Vulnerability Audit:</strong> Assess security of network infrastructure, controls, and software. Attempt penetration of your network using tools and techniques a hacker may use to gain access to your IT Infrastructure. Identify where those holes may be, and implement solutions to fix them.</p>
<p><strong>Wireless and mobile assessment:</strong> Audit your systems' ability to protect your wireless assets. Conduct technical and configuration reviews, and scan for rogue access points. Assess how mobile devices interact with the backend of your business systems and the data flow between them.</p>
<p>We'll take care of your IT security, so you don't have to worry.</p>
