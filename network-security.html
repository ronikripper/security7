This can lead to complex operations and an increase to overhead cost. Security7 Networks wants to help you eliminate these issues with an all-in-one security solution, also known as Unified Threat Management (UTM).</p><p>A UTM combines all of the basic IT security measures in one single device. With this solution, your business&rsquo; network security can be more easily managed since the application, control, and maintenance of your network&rsquo;s content are all managed in a centralized location. This prevents you from having to institute security updates to all of your workstations, saving you time and boosting profitability.</p><h4><strong>Increase Productivity</strong></h4><p><img style="float: right;" alt="" width="" height="" /></p><h4>Increase your workforce&rsquo;s productivity by implementing content control.</h4><p>Your staff members have different values, opinions, and levels of efficiency. As a result, it's important to be able to deter user access to certain elements that may otherwise prove costly to your business. These elements can include:</p><ul><li>job searches</li><li>social networking websites</li><li>microblogging websites</li><li>video streaming</li><li>distasteful content such as adult -oriented websites and file sharing sites</li><li>any other site that can sap productivity</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By implementing a UTM appliance from Security7 Networks, you have complete control over what type of content is accessible to authorized employees. Studies show that the average employee wastes around two hours of company time per day on personal internet use. Prevent workforce inefficiencies today with a Unified Threat Management Solution.</p><h4><strong>Prevent Security Threats</strong></h4><h4>Eliminate intrusion and stay up to date.</h4><p>One of the reasons why intrusions happen is because security software is out of date. Security companies do a good job of keeping pace with hackers, but if you don&rsquo;t promptly apply applicable patches, you leave your entire IT infrastructure at risk of exploits. With a UTM from Security7 Networks, your security is never in question because updating one centralized location eliminates the possibility of forgetting to update all your devices.</p><p>For more information about our network security solutions, including the UTM, call us today at (877) 664-9379.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>
