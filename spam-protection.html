Unfortunately, one of the primary faults in email communication is the prevalence of spam. If your organization only works with the bare essentials of spam protection, you&rsquo;re likely wasting both time and money that could be better spent elsewhere.</p><p>The average small and medium-sized business shouldn&rsquo;t have to deal with spam complications on a regular basis. Security7 Networks&rsquo;s comprehensive spam protection solution is designed to help your organization eliminate spam before it ever hits your inbox. By deploying a comprehensive spam protection strategy, you and your staff can get down to business without having to first sift through piles of useless messages.</p><p>Eliminate Unnecessary Costs</p><p>Free up extra funds for use in other, more important avenues of business.</p><p>Spam is a major problem for many organizations that don&rsquo;t have adequate protection. Spam accounts for just over 50% of all emails sent, and according to another survey, at least $712 is lost per year for every one of your employees due to the time wasted from dealing with spam. It&rsquo;s clear that the costs and lost productivity adds up. By integrating a spam protection solution, you&rsquo;ll be able to keep your employees from being overwhelmed with spam; leading to increased productivity and improved organizational efficiency.</p><p>Mitigate IT Security Risks</p><p>Drastically reduce the possibility of stray threats on your network.</p><p>Spam is a primary mode of transportation for threats like viruses, malware, spyware, and other risks to your business&rsquo; cyber security. If your users accidentally open a spam message that&rsquo;s disguised as a genuine message, it could have a widespread effect on your entire IT infrastructure. Therefore, it&rsquo;s crucial that you eliminate this potential threat before something slips through your defenses.</p><p>Security7 Networks&rsquo;s spam protection is a completely hosted solution that uses intelligent, pre-designed filters to keep suspicious emails from entering your network in the first place. Anything blocked is quarantined for you to review, which ensures you don&rsquo;t miss an important email.</p><p>Take Back Your Workday</p><p>Save precious time by eliminating spam and junk mail.</p><p>The majority of the email your organization receives is likely to be spam. Sifting through spam is a huge waste of your staff&rsquo;s time, which could be much better spent on profitable initiatives. By eliminating spam, you&rsquo;re essentially giving your company the chance to jump-start operations, improve workflow, and gain the competitive edge.</p><p><br />Security7 Networks&rsquo;s spam protection solution is designed to keep your spam at an absolute minimum, so your staff can stop wasting time and better manage their inbox.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t Let Spam Get the Best of Your Business</p><p>Contact Security7 Networks today to discuss dynamic security solutions.</p><p>If your business is fighting a losing battle against spam, now is the time to seize control of your email.
