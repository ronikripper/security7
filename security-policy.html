They automate mission critical processes and house crucial information such as customer data, financial records, and intellectual property. To safeguard these assets, all organizations need to develop a written corporate IT security policy that defines how IT assets are to be protected, expected employee behaviors, and the consequences of violations.</span></p><p>A well-crafted security policy not only protects the assets themselves, but also reduces corporate risk. It shields the organization from the financial impact of unnecessary downtime, lawsuits resulting from IT system misuse, and the consequences of unauthorized modification or deletion of data. Written security policies are also required by a wide variety of government and industry regulations including Massachusetts' data privacy law (201 CMR 17), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), to name a few. Failure to comply with these laws can lead to fines, increased transaction costs, and other penalties, which are additional forms of corporate risk.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="/my-documents/finish/7-case-studies/14-policywerx-data-sheet/0"><img style="margin: 5px 10px 0px 0px; float: right;" alt="" width="231" height="43" src="/images/dl_datasheet.png.png" /></a></p><h3><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" />&nbsp;</h3><h3>Policy Development Services to Ensure Results are Achieved Quickly and Cost Effectively</h3><h4>Most organizations have access to internal IT resources, however they are typically not well-suited to the task of developing a corporate IT security policy for a variety of reasons.</h4><p>Security7 Networks is an experienced IT services provider which offers a comprehensive security policy development and implementation service.
