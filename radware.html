<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Today, online businesses and data centers face multiple types of attacks that hit every layer of the IT infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network layer is targeted with volumetric network flood attacks, network scans, and network intrusions, aiming to consume or misuse networking resources. Volumetric flood attacks can saturate an organization’s Internet pipe causing a complete denial of service. In 2012, 15% of the attacks handled by Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) were attacks that blocked the network pipe.</li>
<li>The server layer is targeted by port scans, SYN flood attacks, and low &amp; slow DoS attack tools, which aim to misuse the server resources.</li>
<li>The application layer is targeted with a wide variety of attacks from application vulnerability exploitations, application misuse attacks and application DDoS attacks, and web application attacks.</li>
 </ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 80%;" src="/images/figure1.jpg" alt="figure1" /><br />The result of such attacks can vary from data breach and web defacement, all the way to service shut down.</p>
<h3>Cyber-hacktivism Spikes</h3>
<p>The past three years has been the most active and destructive period in the history of cyber threats. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks were carried out with increased sophistication and persistence with destructive results. In September 2012, some of the largest U.S. financial institutions, such as NYSE, Bank of America and Chase Bank, experienced massive DDoS attacks that disrupted customer transactions for hours.</p>
<p>Early in 2013, Anonymous hackers were jailed for carrying out cyber-attacks on Visa, MasterCard and PayPal, one of which cost a website £3.5 million. Other Anonymous attacks brought down the sites of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Interpol, the Vatican, the Federal Reserve and others.</p>
<h3>Reassessing the Risk of Cyber Attacks</h3>
<p>No one can say for certain how all of this will play out, however given the increased frequency, directed attacks, and effectiveness of the techniques, we can safely assume the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cyber attacks go mainstream for activists and for financially motivated criminal organizations.</strong> Attackers’ motivation has evolved from publicity and vandalism. They are now looking for financial gain or protest without going out of their homes.</li>
<li><strong>Reassessing the risk</strong> – your organization is likely a target. For example, eCommerce sites, which were the prime target for financially motivated attackers, become now also targets for hacktivism.</li>
<li><strong>Cyber weapons of mass disruption deploy multi-vulnerability DoS &amp; DDoS attacks.</strong> This turns traditional network security measures useless, as they typically can detect and defend only some of the attack vectors.</li>
<li><strong>The need for complementing security technologies.</strong> Mitigating multi-vulnerability and multi-vector attacks requires more than one security technology in place. It is critical to add behavioral analysis technologies on top traditional signature detection and rate-based protection.</li>
<li><strong>The need for complementing security technologies.</strong> Mitigating multi-vulnerability and multi-vector attacks requires more than one security technology in place. It is critical to add behavioral analysis technologies on top traditional signature detection and rate-based protection.</li>
<li><strong>Architecting the perimeter for attack mitigation.</strong> Deployment of complementing network security technology requires rethinking of perimeter security.</li>
<li><strong>Counterattacks are needed!</strong> Defense mitigation strategies are also evolving and now include active counterattack strategies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Attackers Deploy Multi-vulnerability Attack Campaigns – Raising the Mitigation Bar</strong></p>
<p>Recent attacks show that attackers are using new techniques known as multi-vulnerability attack campaigns. During this, the attackers set the Botnet (or instruct their fans, as in the case of the Anonymous group operations), to launch several attack types in parallel, targeting multiple vulnerability points of the victim’s IT infrastructure, such as the network, servers, and the application layers. Multi-vulnerability attack campaigns are highly destructive, even though each attack vector is well known (examples are UDP flood targeting the network bandwidth resources, SYN flood targeting the server resources, HTTP Get flood targeting the web application resources). The victim is at high risk because if one attack vector hits the target, the result is destructive. The attackers’ assumption is that even if their victims deploy multiple protection tools, there are blind spots in their perimeter network security architecture and therefore are exposed to a few of the attack vectors.</p>
<p>Radware believes that there is a clear need to complement existing network security technologies, such as firewalls and network IPS, in order to protect businesses against existing and future attacks.</p>
<h3>Mapping Security Protection Tools</h3>
<p>Going back to the threat landscape, we can now better understand and map the required protection tools to fully safeguard an online business or data center. To fully protect against all type of attacks that target the IT infrastructure, you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>DoS protection to fend off volumetric network DDoS flood attacks.</li>
<li>Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA) to detect and prevent zero-day and non-vulnerability based attacks, where the attackers are replicating real user’s behavior to misuse application resources.</li>
<li>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and protect against known application vulnerability exploits.</li>
<li>IP reputation to prevent financial fraud attacks, social attacks such as phishing, and malware contamination.</li>
<li>Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against web application attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 80%;" src="/images/figure2.jpg" alt="figure2" /><br />An integrated approach is required to make sure there are no blind spots in perimeter and application security, and to save on deployment, management, and integration costs.</p>
<h2>Radware Attack Mitigation System</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Radware’s Attack Mitigation System (AMS) is a real-time network and application attack mitigation solution that protects the organizational infrastructure against network &amp; application downtime, application vulnerability exploitation, malware spread, information theft, web service attacks and web defacement.</p>
<p>Combining on-premises mitigation equipment and cloud-based protection, Radware’s AMS provides the most comprehensive protection against availability based threats.</p>
<p>Radware’s Attack Mitigation System contains three layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Protections layer</strong> – a set of on-premise security modules including: Denial-of-service (DoS) protection, Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA), Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), Reputation Engine and Web Application Firewall (WAF) - to fully safeguard networks, servers and applications against known and emerging network security threats. On-premise protection is complemented with DefensePipe, a cloudbased service protecting against Internet pipe saturation.</li>
<li><strong>Security risk management</strong> - Built-in Security Event Information Management (SEIM) collects and analyzes events from all modules to provide enterprise-view situational awareness.</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Response Team (ERT)</strong> - Consisting of knowledgeable and specialized security experts who provide 24x7 instantaneous services for customers facing a denial-of-service (DoS) attack in order to restore network and service operational status.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="max-width: 80%;" src="/images/figure3.jpg" alt="figure3" /></p>
<p>The synergy of multiple protection modules at part of one system enables more effective protection against attackers who seek to compromise the business assets systematically when compared to stand alone solutions deployment, while providing unified reporting and compliance</p>
<p><strong>AMS Protection Modules</strong><br />AMS is comprised of 5 protection modules; all optimized for online business and data centre protection, and designed for data center and carrier deployments:</p>
<p>DoS Protection – Prevent all type of network DDoS attacks including:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Cutting-edge Security Technologies</strong></p>
<p>Radware AMS uses multiple technologies to provide complete attack protection for online businesses, data centers and networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>DoS Protection</strong> module is based on several technologies: signature detection, behavioral based realtime signatures, and SYN cookies mechanism that challenge new connections prior to establishing a new session with the servers.</li>
<li>The <strong>Network Behavioral Analysis (NBA)</strong> module employs patented behavioral-based real-time signature technology. It creates baselines of normal network, application, and user behavior. When an anomalous behavior is detected as an attack, the NBA module creates a real-time signature that uses the attack characteristics, and starts blocking the attack immediately. In case of DDoS attacks, it injects the real-time signature into the DME hardware, offloading the main CPUs from the excessive unwanted traffic.</li>
<li>The <strong>Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)</strong> module is based on stateful static signature detection technology, with periodic signature updates and emergency updates, in case of a newly discovered high risk attacks.</li>
<li>The <strong>Reputation Engine</strong> offers real-time anti-Trojan and anti-phishing service, targeted to fight against financial fraud, information theft, and malware spread.</li>
<li>The <strong>Web Application Firewall (WAF)</strong> offers patent-protected technology to create and maintain security policies for the widest security coverage with the lowest false positives and the lowest operational effort. The WAF auto policy generation module analyzes the security related attributes of the protected web application and derives the potential threats in the application. The web application is mapped into application zones, each with its own common potential threats. It then generates granular protection rules per zone, and sets a policy-in-blocking mode once it has completed an optimization process that minimizes false-positives while maintaining best security coverage.</li>
</ul>
<p style="float: right;"><img src="/images/iamge4.jpg" alt="iamge4" /></p>
<br /><p><strong>Defense Pipe</strong><br />DefensePipe is a cloud based service that extends the on-premise defense layer to protectagainst Internet pipe saturation.</p>
<p>During a volumetric network attack that threatens to saturate the Internet pipe, the on-premise AMS alerts the DefensePipe cloud data center that the pipe is about to get saturated, and passes essential data about the attack characteristics.</p>
<p>Once it is decided that the mitigation should move to the cloud, all traffic is diverted to the DefensePipe scrubbing center. Data is scrutinized and cleansed and only then is sent back to the organizational network.</p>
<p style="clear: both;">The automatic synchronization between the DefensePipe and the on-premises modules ensures the fastest response time to volumetric attacks. Traffic is diverted as a last resort, only when the attack threatens to saturate the organizational internet pipe.</p>
<p style="float: left;"><img style="margin-right: 14px;" src="/images/figure5.jpg" alt="figure5" /></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Security Risk Management</h3>
<h4 style="margin-bottom: 5px;">Best-of-breed Reporting and Forensics Engine</h4>
<p>Built-in Security Information Event Management (SIEM) system provides an enterprise-wide view of security and compliance status from a single console. Data is collected from both on-premises equipment and the cloud-based mitigation and presented in a consolidated view of dashboards and reports. These views provide extensive yet simple drilldown capabilities that allow users to easily drill into information to speed incident identification and provide root cause analysis, improving collaboration between NOC and SOC teams, and accelerating the resolution of security incidents.</p>
<p style="margin: 0; clear: both; height: 0;"> </p>
<p style="float: right;"><img style="margin-left: 14px;" src="/images/figure6.jpg" alt="figure6" /></p>
<h4>Complete Alignment with Enterprise Compliance</h4>
<h4>Requirements and Regulations</h4>
<p>The SIEM provides complete alignment with the enterprise’s compliance, regulations, and business processes, providing compliance and audit professionals with a complete picture of compliance across the enterprise. It ensures the appropriate separation of duties, collection of information, configuration, and operation auditing mandated by business processes, regulations, and information security standards (PCI-DSS, SOX, HIPAA, etc).</p>
<p style="margin: 0; clear: both; height: 0;"> </p>
<h4>Full Alert Lifecycle Management</h4>
<p>The SIEM provides IT managers with a rich set of tools to manage all the alerts (availability, performance, security, and more), within their infrastructure. Alerts are managed from the moment they surface (identification stage), through ticket opening, analysis, resolution, and verification until the problem is resolved and summarized.</p>
<h4>Emergency Response Team (ERT)</h4>
<p>Radware AMS delivers the best attack coverage in the industry for online businesses and data centers. We deliver the widest out-of-the-box protection set.</p>
<p>Yet, as attackers are getting more sophisticated by the day, there is a chance that they will launch a new form or type of attack for which the AMS may not be triggered out-of-the-box. For those cases, which are not frequent, the user is required to perform the analysis of the attack traffic and configure protection rules manually.</p>
<p>On the other hand, not all users have the skills or the experience in applying security rules in real-time when under attack. That’s why we established Radware’s Emergency Response Team (ERT) to provide customers with 24x7, security expert services for hands-on attack mitigation assistance to help successfully defend their network against cyber attacks.</p>
<p>The ERT team provides the required expertise needed during prolonged, multi-vector attacks. This may include working closely with customers to decide on the diversion of traffic during volumetric attacks, assisting with capturing files, analyzing the situation and offering various mitigation options.</p>
<p style="float: right;"><img style="margin-left: 14px;" src="/images/figure7.jpg" alt="figure7" /></p>
