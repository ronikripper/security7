For example, if you need to expand your workforce and add more workstations to your fleet, then you will have to have technicians spend extra time running new landlines to each workstation. VoIP uses your LAN to transmit data. These are the same lines that run the Internet which means that with VoIP, you won&rsquo;t have to run any extra lines.</p><p>VoIP is not limited to your local Internet connection, and you can even go wireless and take advantage of your network&rsquo;s Wi-Fi capabilities! The beauty of VoIP is that you can plug in your IP-enabled phone to an Internet connection from anywhere in the world and use your VoIP phone number.
